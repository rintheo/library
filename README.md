# Library
A library made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Instead of books, animes are stored similar to MyAnimeList and similar websites. [View Demo](https://rintheo.github.io/library/)

## Features
- With 14 entries pre-added
- Add new entry to library as a form overlaying the screen
    - Clicking outside the form when the required inputs are empty closes it
    - Basic validations
    - Default submit behavior prevented for now 
- Remove entry
- Toggle watched(true/false) on entry
- Hover effects
- Responsive on desktop and mobile

## Issues
- State is not saved for now
- Image only accepts URLs for now

## To implement
- Some form of storage (local/cloud)
- Card sorting (By Date Added, Alphabetical, etc.)
- Upload own image for preview
